# IP Assignment Solution for Cloned VMs

## Problem Description

The issue was that cloned VMs were not being assigned IP addresses automatically after cloning. While the application layer was generating and assigning IP addresses from the pool, these addresses were never actually configured on the VMs themselves, leaving them without proper network connectivity.

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **VMware Provider**: The `_configure_cloned_vm` method only configured CPU and RAM settings but ignored IP address configuration.
2. **Nutanix Provider**: The `clone_vm` method created VMs but didn't apply the assigned IP addresses to the VM's network configuration.
3. **Missing Integration**: No mechanism existed to actually configure the network settings inside the guest operating systems.

## Solution Overview

The solution implements a comprehensive IP assignment system with the following components:

### 1. IP Assignment Scripts (`scripts/` directory)

#### `assign_ip_vmware.py`
- **Purpose**: Assigns static IP addresses to VMware VMs
- **Features**:
  - Automatic guest OS detection (Linux/Windows)
  - VMware Tools integration for guest communication
  - Linux: Uses netplan configuration
  - Windows: Uses netsh commands
  - Verification of IP assignment
  - Proper VM state management (start/stop as needed)

#### `assign_ip_nutanix.py`
- **Purpose**: Assigns static IP addresses to Nutanix VMs
- **Features**:
  - Prism Central API integration
  - Automatic subnet detection
  - Network configuration updates
  - Task monitoring and verification
  - IP assignment validation

#### `ip_assignment_manager.py`
- **Purpose**: Unified interface for IP assignment across hypervisors
- **Features**:
  - Provider-agnostic IP assignment
  - Configuration management
  - Post-clone IP assignment workflow
  - Error handling and reporting

### 2. Provider Integration

#### VMware Provider Updates
- Added `_assign_ip_address()` method
- Integrated IP assignment into `_configure_cloned_vm()`
- Automatic IP configuration after VM cloning
- Error handling and logging

#### Nutanix Provider Updates
- Added `_assign_ip_address()` method
- Integrated IP assignment into `clone_vm()` workflow
- API-based network configuration
- Task monitoring and verification

### 3. Workflow Integration

The IP assignment is now automatically triggered during the VM cloning process:

1. **VM Cloning**: Standard cloning process creates the VM
2. **Basic Configuration**: CPU, RAM, and other settings are applied
3. **IP Assignment**: If an IP address is specified in the VM configuration:
   - The appropriate IP assignment script is called
   - Guest OS is detected and configured accordingly
   - Network settings are applied inside the VM
   - Assignment is verified
4. **Completion**: VM is ready with proper network configuration

## Usage

### Automatic Usage (Recommended)
IP assignment happens automatically when cloning VMs through the web interface or API:

```python
# When cloning a VM, the IP is automatically assigned
vm_config = VMConfig(
    name="test-vm",
    cpu=2,
    ram=2048,
    disk=20,
    ip_address="192.168.122.150"  # This will be automatically configured
)

result = hypervisor_manager.clone_vm("ubuntu", vm_config, "vmware")
```

### Manual Usage
You can also use the scripts directly:

#### VMware:
```bash
python scripts/assign_ip_vmware.py "C:\path\to\vm.vmx" "192.168.122.150"
```

#### Nutanix:
```bash
python scripts/assign_ip_nutanix.py "127.0.0.1" "admin" "password" "vm-name" "192.168.122.150"
```

#### Unified Manager:
```bash
python scripts/ip_assignment_manager.py vmware "C:\path\to\vm.vmx" "192.168.122.150"
python scripts/ip_assignment_manager.py nutanix "vm-name" "192.168.122.150"
```

## Configuration

### Network Settings
The default network configuration can be customized:

- **IP Range**: 192.168.122.100-200 (configured in `ip_manager.py`)
- **Netmask**: 255.255.255.0
- **Gateway**: 192.168.122.1
- **DNS**: 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4

### Hypervisor Configuration
Configuration is loaded from `hypervisor_config.json`:

```json
{
  "providers": {
    "vmware": {
      "enabled": true,
      "vmrun_path": "C:\\Program Files (x86)\\VMware\\VMware Workstation\\vmrun.exe"
    },
    "nutanix": {
      "enabled": true,
      "prism_central_ip": "127.0.0.1",
      "username": "admin",
      "password": "password",
      "port": 9441,
      "use_ssl": false,
      "verify_ssl": false
    }
  }
}
```

## Testing

A comprehensive test suite is provided in `test_ip_assignment.py`:

```bash
python test_ip_assignment.py
```

The test suite verifies:
- IP assignment manager initialization
- VMware IP assignment script functionality
- Nutanix IP assignment script functionality
- Integration with hypervisor providers

## Error Handling

The solution includes robust error handling:

1. **Script Import Errors**: Graceful fallback if IP assignment scripts are missing
2. **Network Connectivity**: Proper error messages for network issues
3. **Guest OS Detection**: Fallback to Linux configuration if OS detection fails
4. **VMware Tools**: Clear error messages if VMware Tools are not available
5. **API Errors**: Detailed error reporting for Nutanix API issues

## Logging and Monitoring

All IP assignment operations are logged with:
- Success/failure status
- Detailed error messages
- IP assignment verification results
- Performance timing information

## Prerequisites

### VMware:
- VMware Workstation installed
- VMware Tools installed in guest VMs
- Guest VMs must have sudo access (for Linux) or Administrator privileges (for Windows)

### Nutanix:
- Prism Central accessible
- Valid credentials with VM management permissions
- Network subnets configured in Nutanix

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **VMware Tools Not Ready**
   - Ensure VMware Tools are installed and running in the guest VM
   - Wait for VM to fully boot before IP assignment

2. **Permission Issues**
   - Linux: Ensure the user has sudo privileges
   - Windows: Ensure the user has Administrator privileges

3. **Network Configuration Conflicts**
   - Check for existing network configurations
   - Verify network adapter names (ens33 for Linux, Ethernet for Windows)

4. **Nutanix API Issues**
   - Verify Prism Central connectivity
   - Check credentials and permissions
   - Ensure subnets are properly configured

### Debug Mode:
Enable verbose logging by setting environment variable:
```bash
export IP_ASSIGNMENT_DEBUG=1
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Support for Additional Guest OS**: CentOS, RHEL, etc.
2. **DHCP Reservation**: Automatic DHCP reservation creation
3. **IPv6 Support**: Dual-stack IP configuration
4. **Network Validation**: Ping tests and connectivity verification
5. **Batch Operations**: Bulk IP assignment for multiple VMs
6. **GUI Integration**: Web interface for IP management
